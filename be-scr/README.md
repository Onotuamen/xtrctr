Unfortunately, i got carried away with scripting that i only remembered to track my progress half way through so i will explain the important steps so far

site is more complicated to scrape than the earlier one as the html structure is more complex -using various tools to make scraping cumbersome like AJAX but we basically have built the script 
/log on to the website
/accept the cookie consent interrupting progress
/populate the search box
/inspect the html structure to target the autocomplete box 
/locate the character
/navigate to his page by choosing the right link
/ading error handling for when the player isnt found
/implement a check to ensure player bame matches search name


TOOLS
Selenium
chrome Driver
cursor AI(claude 3.5 sonnet)
A lot of willpower
